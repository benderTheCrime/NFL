## Steps to Deploy

1. Make sure all of your "ready to merge" changes have been merged to develop
2. Make sure the version in the following files has been bumped on develop (try to follow the pattern that already exists in those files):
    * `bower.json`
    * `package.json`
3. Hit the button with extreme caution.
